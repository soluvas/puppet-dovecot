# NOTE: If you're not using authentication binds, you'll need to give
# dovecot-auth read access to userPassword field in the LDAP server.
# With OpenLDAP this is done by modifying /etc/ldap/slapd.conf. There should
# already be something like this:

# access to attribute=userPassword
#        by dn="<dovecot's dn>" read # add this

# Use authentication binding for verifying password's validity. This works by

# search, the binding is switched back to the default DN.

# If authentication binding is used, you can save one LDAP request per login
# if users' DN can be specified with a common template. The template can use
# the standard %variables (see user_filter). Note that you can't
# use any pass_attrs if you use this setting.
#
# If you use this setting, it's a good idea to use a different
# dovecot-ldap.conf.ext for userdb (it can even be a symlink, just as long as
# the filename is different in userdb's args). That way one connection is used
# only for LDAP binds and another connection is used for user lookups.
# Otherwise the binding is changed to the default DN before each user lookup.
#
# For example:
#   auth_bind_userdn = cn=%u,ou=people,o=org
#
#auth_bind_userdn =
<% if !auth_bind_userdn.empty? %>auth_bind_userdn = <%= auth_bind_userdn %><% end %>

#pass_attrs = uid=user,userPassword=password,\
